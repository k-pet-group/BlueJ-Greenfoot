This scenario is a start of a simple lift simulation.

Currently, it is to demonstrate some base techniques only -
it is unfinished.

The current implementation cheats in many ways: people do not properly
enter lifts (they are just erased when a lift reaches a floor) and the 
count of people in lifts is fake.

This all needs to be done properly to finish of this project.

Also, the lifts follow a primitive algorithm: they go up and down
randomly. (The call button does not actually do anything.)

As I said, this is just intended as a demo to show what would be possible.
If you like, fix this project so that it behaves properly!
