Greenfoot Architecture and Design
---------------------------------

Davin McCall, 2013

This document describes the architecture and design of the Greenfoot software.


1. INTRODUCTION

This document is written for the benefit of anyone who wants to develop, fix bugs in,
or otherwise understand the Greenfoot software. It describes the overall design and
points out key locations in code.


2. OVERVIEW

Importantly, Greenfoot is essentially an extension to BlueJ; to understand Greenfoot it
is first necessary to understand BlueJ. Please see BlueJ documentation. In particular,
it is important to understand the separate virtual machines - the "main VM" for BlueJ
itself (including the user interface) and the "debug VM" which runs user code (and small
pieces of BlueJ support code).

Greenfoot follows the same pattern: the main VM runs the interface, and the debug VM
runs the user code.  A shared memory file is used to send user interface commands
(keypresses, etc) from the main VM to the debug VM, and to send back the latest world
image from the debug VM to the main VM.


3. GREENFOOT STARTUP

The BlueJ part of Greenfoot launches first. BlueJ is run in a special "Greenfoot" mode
which changes certain aspects of its behaviour; so, there is some Greenfoot-specific code
in BlueJ (however this is and should be kept to a practical minimum).

BlueJ will load Greenfoot via dynamic class loading if in the Greenfoot mode by  
instantiating the greenfoot.guifx.GreenfootGuiHandler class and setting it as the GUI handler.

When BlueJ has completed normal startup, it calls the initialOpenComplete() method of the
greenfoot.guifx.GreenfootGuiHandler class, which proceeds to create the user interface
(GreenfootStage).

So far, everything described as occurred on the main VM.

When a scenario is opened (including the case where Greenfoot is started and the previous
scenario is re-opened automatically), the ProjectManager (greenfoot.core.ProjectManager) is
notified; it registers a listener on the debugger for the project (GreenfootDebugHandler) which
will be notified when the secondary VM has started (processDebuggerEvent(...)) and which will
launch the secondary VM side of Greenfoot using BlueJ's invocation mechanism. Specifically it
creates an instance of GreenfootLauncherDebugVM in the debug VM, passing various important paths
(including the path of the shared memory file for communication) as arguments.

At this point, the debug VM is initialised, and startup is complete.


4. THE SIMULATION THREAD AND EXECUTION OF USER CODE

The Simulation class, derived from Thread, represents the simulation thread. It can be paused,
resumed and disabled; listeners can be attached to be notified of changes in the simulation
state. A 'runLater' method is provided, similar to EventQueue.invokeLater(...), to queue a task
to be run on the simulation thread.


6. GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE

The GUI elements are in the greenfoot.guifx.* package. The main windows is represented by
greenfoot.guifx.GreenfootStage. The class browser (the tree view that displays classes) is in
greenfoot.guifx.classes.*.
