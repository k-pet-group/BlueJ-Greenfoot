Greenfoot is built as an extension to BlueJ. The Greenfoot source
bundle contains both the bluej and greenfoot (extension) project
trees. In order to build Greenfoot in Eclipse you need to set up two
separate projects in eclipse, one for the BlueJ core and one for the
Greenfoot extension. The BlueJ core project must be set up before you
proceed with setting up the (separate) Greenfoot project.


0. First follow the instructions for configuring and building BlueJ in
   Eclipse in the bluej/doc/HOWTO.build-bluej-in-eclipse document.


Next, you need to set up a Greenfoot project.

1. Import the greenfoot source code into eclipse as per Step 1 in
   the HOWTO instructions for BlueJ, but this time for the "greenfoot"
   folder.


2. JRE: Check to make sure that the jdk jre (and not just the non-jdk
        jre installed alongside the jdk) is available. This should
        have already been performed while setting up BlueJ. See the
        BlueJ instructions as noted above for details.


3. Project Properties: Set up source and output paths, and char encoding.

   NOTE: These instructions assume that the projects are named "bluej"
         and "greenfoot" respectively and that the "greenfoot" project
         has been selected in the project explorer pane on the left.
         Some paths in the following steps may need to be adjusted if
         you use different project names.


   Project properties -> Resource

   * Select "UTF-8" as the character encoding.
   * Select unix style line breaks.


   Project properties -> Java Build Path

   In the Source tab:

   * Check the "Allow output folders for source folders" option.

   * Add source folders as necessary with "Add Folder..." 
     and set output folder (click on Output folder, then "Edit").
     There should be two source folders:

     - source folder "greenfoot/src" 
       should have output folder "greenfoot/classes"
     - source folder "greenfoot/test/src" 
       should have output folder "greenfoot/test/classes"

   * Remove any additional source folders


   In the projects tab:
 
   * Select the BlueJ project as required project.


   In the libraries tab:
   
   * "Add JARs" (or "Add Variable..." if using classpath vars): add all
     the jars in the "greenfoot/lib" folder (remove any 'persisted
     containers'.)  At the time of this writing (11/2014 v2.4.0) these
     are:

     - AppleJavaExtensions.jar (NOTE: add from bluej/lib if not in greenfoot/lib)
     - commons-logging-api-1.1.2.jar (NOTE: add from bluej/lib if not in greenfoot/lib)
     - jl1.0.1.jar
     - junit-4.12.jar (NOTE: add from bluej/lib if not in greenfoot/lib)
     - hamcrest-core-1.3.jar (NOTE: add from bluej/lib if not in greenfoot/lib)
     - opencsv-2.3.jar

   * "Add External JARs" (or Add Variable... if using classpath vars): 
     add the "tools.jar" file from your JDK in [your jdk root]\lib
      

4. Configuring and running ant

   You need to run the ant build scripts to put certain files in the
   correct places before you can build and run greenfoot:

   * Edit the greenfoot/build.properties to set local paths.

     Eclipse likes to open the file build.properties with a "Build
     Configuration" editor - you don't want that.  Right-click and
     choose "open with", "Properties file editor".

   * Right click in greenfoot project view on
     build.xml->Run as "ant build..." (ellipis important). 

   * Click on jre tab and make sure that the jdk (not just a jre) 
     is selected. 


   Window->Show View->Other... 

   * Select Ant->Ant in pop-up dialog

   * Drag-n-drop the greenfoot/build.xml file from the greenfoot
     project into the Ant view.

   * (Repeat the step above for bluej/build.xml if you haven't already)

   * Run the bluej "ready-to-run" target by double clicking on it in
     the Ant view .

   * Run the greenfoot "update-version-number" task to generate splash screens
     (needed once unless version changes).

   * Run the greenfoot "ready-to-run" target by double clicking on it
     in the Ant view
     
   * In the package explorer view, right click on bluej/boot/src/bluej
     and choose "refresh". greenfoot-splash.png should now be listed in
     bluej/boot/src/bluej as a resource.


5. Running Greenfoot from within Eclipse

   Most edits will not require re-running the ant build targets nor
   installing greenfoot to test (although editing some classes will
   require re-running the ant targets before you can test.)

   You can edit the source and run Greenfoot from within Eclipse (but
   the ant "ready-to-run" targets must have been built at least once
   for this to work.)  To do this you need to have Eclipse set to
   "build automatically" (Project->"build automatically") and you need
   a run configuration:


   Run->Run Configurations...
   
   * Select "Java Application" and click the "New" button to create a
     new run configuration for greenfoot

   * Name it whatever you like, e.g. 'greenfoot_runconfig'.

   In the Main tab:

   * Project should be the bluej project (not the greenfoot project.)
   * Main class should be bluej.Boot.

   In the Arguments tab:

   * Set the Program arguments:
    (Not indented for easier copy&paste, but *don't* *forget* to set
    the -greenfootclassesdir=../greenfoot/classes option
    appropriately, otherwise you'll get a lot of weird file not found
    exceptions (and Greenfoot reports that "an error occurred in
    extracting the archive contents") that you'll have to trace back
    to this faulty option.)

-greenfoot=true
-greenfootclassesdir=[path to 'classes' directory within greenfoot as seen from bluej project, e.g. ../greenfoot/classes]
-useclassesdir=true
-javafxpath=/path/to/javafx
-bluej.debug=true
-bluej.compiler.showunchecked=false


   In the JRE tab:

   * check that the jre being used is the jdk jre. 
     If necessary, add the jdk as jre as described in
     the bluej/doc/HOWTO.build-bluej-in-eclipse document.


   In the Classpath tab:

   * The bootstrap entries should contain only the JRE Sytem Library

   * The user entries should contain the "bluej/boot/classes" folder
     (Advanced..., Add folder), and the tools.jar from the JDK (Add
     External Jars... or Advanced..., Add Classpath Var if using
     classpath vars).  You do not need the "classes" folder nor any of
     the other jar files.

   * Apply the changes and run the configuration to test.

   
6. Hacking Greenfoot

   * Hack the source and run the run configuration using the "run"
     button in the toolbar to test.

   * Some changes (e.g. to the RMI classes) may require re-running the
     "ready-to-run" ant target in the greenfoot build.xml file.

   * If you are editing classes that require an ant re-build to test,
     you might want to *temporarily* remove the javadoc target
     dependencies "create-api-docs" and "copy-apidocs" from the
     "ready-to-run" target and comment out the javadoc target in the
     "copy-common-class" target in the build.xml file to reduce the
     build time considerably.  Don't forget to put them back in 
     when you're done testing!

   * Happy Hacking ;-)


==========================================================================
Common problems and their solution (if all the steps above are
followed to the letter, then none of the problems should occur):


1. Launching Greenfoot fails/complains because greenfoot-splash.png isn't
   found, even though it's in the bluej/boot/src/ dir.  Attempting to 
   add the image to the bluej/boot/src resource in eclipse fails.

This is because even though the ant ready-to-run target has copied the
image to bluej/boot/src, the resource hasn't been imported into
eclipse. Importing in eclipse now fails, because the file already
exists in the destination dir, yet isn't listed in the project view.

Simply refreshing bluej/boot/src/bluej solves this.

In the package explorer view in eclipse, after running the greenfoot
ant "ready-to-run target" right click on bluej/boot/src/bluej 
and choose "refresh". greenfoot-splash.png should now be listed in
bluej/boot/src/bluej as a resource.


2. When attempting to run greenfoot runconfig, bluej.Boot can't find
   tools.jar.

This is (probably) because the call System.getProperty("java.home") in
bluej.Boot is returning C:\Programme\Java\jre7 or similar and the
regular non-jdk jre doesn't contain the tools.jar.  The default (and
only) jre set in eclipse after a virgin installation of jdk + eclipse
in windows seems to be just the regular non-jdk jre.

This also isn't a windows environment var problem, rather an eclipse
setting (default jre). Setting JAVA_HOME as env var in windows doesn't
help because eclipse sets it's own JAVA_HOME according to workspace
and/or project settings.

Add the jdk dir as jre in eclipse (Window->Preference->Java->Installed
JREs) and select as project/workspace jre (either select as default
jre for the whole workspace or for this project in the project run
configuration). Now JAVA_HOME in eclipse is the jdk dir and the system
call in the bluej code finds the tools.jar.


3. Eclipse complains with thousands of "cannot resolve type/variable"
   errors for classes which are in the bluej project.

I've had this error sporadically. It seems to be due to
inconsistencies arising between the eclipse and ant build systems.
Usually running project->clean->"clean all" in Eclipse and both ant
clean targets for bluej and greenfoot fixes it. After this you'll need
to re-run the ant ready-to-run targets as described above.


4. The ant target ready-to-run fails to build because javadoc isn't found:

This results when ant is configured to use a non-jdk jre and javadoc
isn't in the system path.

Right click on build.xml->run as "ant build..." (ellipis important).
Click on jre tab and make sure that the jdk (not just a jre) is
selected.

Alternative solution: add the tools.jar to the ant classpath in
Window->Preferences->Ant->Runtime global settings.

Alternative solution: make sure that javadoc is in the system path.
