Setting up BlueJ and Greenfoot in IntelliJ 2016.*:

Go to File->New->Project from Version Control->Git
URL: https://gitlab.bluej.org/gitlab-username/bjgf.git
Check out to wherever.  In the past, IntelliJ prompted for creating new modules
  after check out, but it doesn't seem to now.  Either way, you'll want to do the
  module set up manually as follows.

NOTE: WHEREVER YOU SEE "bjgf" BELOW, CHANGE THAT TO BE THE FULL PATH YOU CHECKED OUT TO.
  For example, for me, instead of bjgf in each case, I have C:\users\neil\intellij\bjgf

IntelliJ will pop up dialogs often during setup asking if you want to add various files to
  version control (e.g. "vcs.xml").  Say no to all of them.  If you accidentally say yes, you
  can always remove them again before committing.

Go to File -> Project Structure...  and select the top Project item on the left.
  Select your Project SDK (aka JDK) to be latest JDK 1.8.
  Make sure that your JDK has lib/tools.jar on the classpath: go to File->Project Structure
  then select SDKs (which is actually shared between projects), select the SDK you want,
  click Edit, and if blah/blah/jdkpath/lib/tools.jar is not on the list, click the "+"
  in the far top right and navigate to the lib/tools.jar file to add it to the list.
  (This may become non-applicable after JDK9).

  Set the language level to Java 8.

  Set the project-wide compiler output directory "File -> Project Structure -> Project" to
  be bjgf/output.  We won't actually use this anyway, as we will override it for each module.

In the same Project Structure window, go to the Libraries section.
  Add a library named "bluej-lib" containing all the JARs in the bjgf/bluej/lib directory.
  Note that selecting the directory is not enough in IntelliJ when creating the library --
  you must multi-select all the JARs inside the lib directory.
  If it asks if you want to add it to any modules, just cancel that dialog.

  Add a library named "greenfoot-lib" containing all the JARs in the bjgf/greenfoot/lib directory.
  Again, you must multi-select the JARs.

In the same Project Structure window, go to the Modules section.
  (IntelliJ makes a module called bjgf that seems to come back when I removed it.
  It seems benign so I left it there.).
  Create the following modules by clicking the "+" at the top of the module list
  and then selecting "New Module".  In each case, select Java from left-hand list
  of the window that pops up.  If not already selected, select latest JDK 1.8
  as Project SDK in the top right, then click Next and fill in details as below.


Modules (in order):

    "threadchecker" module.  Content root and module file location: bjgf/bluej/threadchecker.
       It should automatically tag src (which is really bjgf/bluej/threadchecker/src) as a source directory.
       Also select "pluginsrc" and mark that as a source directory.
       Under Paths, select "Use module compile path" and enter bjgf/bluej/threadchecker/classes for both paths.

    "bluej-boot" module.  Content root and module file location: bjgf/bluej/boot.
       It should automatically tag src (which is really bjgf/bluej/boot/src) as a source directory.
       Under Dependencies, click the "+" and select Module Dependency... and select "threadchecker".
       Under Paths, select "Use module compile path" and enter bjgf/bluej/boot/classes for both paths.

    "bluej" module.  Content root and module file location: bjgf/bluej.
       It should automatically tag src (which is really bjgf/bluej/src) as a source directory.
       Also select test/src, and mark that as a tests directory.
       Under Paths, select "Use module compile path" and enter bjgf/bluej/classes for both paths.
       Under Dependencies, click the "+" and select Module Dependency... and select "threadchecker".
       Similarly, click the "+" and select Module Dependency... and select "bluej-boot".
       Click the "+" and select Library and select "bluej-lib".

After adding these modules, try compiling (Build menu -> Build Project).  It should be successful.
Then to set up Greenfoot, add this additional module:

    "greenfoot" module.  Content root and module file location: bjgf/greenfoot.
       It should automatically tag src (which is really bjgf/greenfoot/src) as a source directory.
       Also select test/src, and mark that as a tests directory.
       Under Paths, select "Use module compile path" and enter bjgf/greenfoot/classes for both paths.
       Under Dependencies, click "+" and select "Module Dependency..." and select
       "threadchecker", ""bluej-boot", "bluej" and "greenfoot-native".
       Click the "+" again and select Library and select "bluej-lib" and "greenfoot-lib".

After adding this modules, try compiling again (Build menu -> Build Project).  It should be successful.

In Project tab on left-hand side (show by hovering over very bottom-left icon in window, then clicking Project),
  find bluej/build.xml.  Right-click on it and select "Add as Ant build file" (near bottom).
  Do the same for greenfoot/build.xml.

Copy bluej/build.properties.template to bluej/build.properties and edit
  to set build_java_home to be the path of your JDK.  On Windows,
  use forward slashes in paths to avoid issues.

Before you can run the BlueJ configuration for the first time, you need to run the ant target
  "update-version-number" from the BlueJ ant file.

Finally, set up the run configurations.  Go to Run menu > Edit Configurations...
Click the "+" in top-left to add new config, select Application from drop-down menu.

  Name the configuration "BlueJ".  Main class is "bluej.Boot".  Program arguments should be:
    -useclassesdir=true -bluej.debug=true
  The first one tells it to use the "classes" subdirectory for class files rather than looking for
  the JARs which we build for the release.  The second tells it to spit out debug output on stderr
  rather than to the bluej log file (you definitely want this during development).
  Set the working directory to bjgf/bluej, and set the classpath to be for module "bluej".

Run this configuration, and it should work.  Then go back to Edit Configurations..., select the
  Copy Configuration icon (third from top left of window) and call the copy Greenfoot.  Only change
  needed is to set the arguments to:
    -useclassesdir=true -bluej.debug=true -greenfoot=true -greenfootclassesdir=bjgf/greenfoot/classes
  (Remember to replace bjgf with full path).

Before you can run the Greenfoot configuration for the first time, you need to run the ant target
  "ready-to-run-greenfoot" from the *BlueJ* ant file, and then also the
  "ready-to-run" and "update-version-number" targets from the Greenfoot ant file.  Once done,
  you should be able to run the Greenfoot configuration successfully.
