There are two possibilities to import the source into Eclipse, from
the source bundle or directly from the svn repository:


1a. Import source code into eclipse from source bundle:

   NOTE: This procedure depends upon whether the source is located in
         the Eclipse Workspace folder or not. See NOTE at the end of
         this file for details.

   * Start Eclipse. Select File->New->Project...

   * In selection Wizard choose "Java Project"


   * Case 1: The source folder is in the Eclipse Workspace
             folder:

    - "Project name": Enter the name of the source folder to import
      exactly as it is named as a subdirectory in the Eclipse
      Workspace folder, e.g. "bluej", as the project name.


   * Case 2: The source folder is not in the Eclipse Workspace folder:

    - Uncheck the "use default location" checkbox

    - "browse" for the location and select the source folder that you
       extracted from the source bundle wherever it is.

    - Set a project name


   * Click "Finish".

   
Alternatively:

1b. Import source code into eclipse from Subversion repository:
   
   NOTE: The main development repository is not public. These
         instructions are applicable for BlueJ developers or if you
         have imported the source code into a repository of your
         own. Either the "subversive" or the "subclipse" plugin is
         required for Eclipse. These instructions are written for the
         "subversive" plugin.

   * Use the "SVN Repository Exploring Perspective"
     (Window -> Open Perspective...).

   * Add the repository location, if you haven't already done so,
     with the "New Repository Location" button (small button with
     an icon depicting a cylinder overlaid with a "+" sign).

   * Locate the bluej folder (under trunk). Right-click it and
     "Find/Check out as..."

   * Select "Check out as a new project configured using the New
     Project Wizard" and then "Finish"

   * Choose "Java Project" and click "Next"

   * Enter a project name and "Finish".


2. JRE: set up the jre to use for the workspace and/or project.

   The jre used needs to be the jdk and not just the jre that gets
   installed alongside the jdk (which seems to be the default setting
   on a virgin installation of jdk + eclipse on windows).
  
   You can either set the jre to use for the workspace (all projects),
   or alternatively, set the jre to use just for this project (see
   below.)
   
   To check/add the JDK JRE as JRE for the workspace:

   Window->Preferences->Java->Installed JREs

   * check that the jdk jre is available as jre. 

   * if e.g. only c:\Programs\Java\jre7 is available, then
     add a new JRE, and select the jdk dir, e.g. 
     c:\Programs\Java\jdk1.7.0_45

   * to set the jdk to be the default jre for the workspace, check
     that box.


3. Project Properties: Set up source and output paths, and char encoding.

   NOTE: These instructions assume that the project is named "bluej"
         and that this project has been selected in the explorer pane
         on the left. Some paths in the following steps may need to 
         be adjusted if you use a different project name.


   Project properties -> Resource

   * Select "UTF-8" as the character encoding.
   * Select unix style line breaks


   Project properties -> Java Build Path

   In the Source tab:
   
   * check the "Allow output folders for source folders" option.

   * Add source folders as necessary with "Add Folder..." 
     and set output folder (click on Output folder, then "Edit").
     There should be three source folders:

      - source folder "bluej/src" 
        should have output folder "bluej/classes"
      - source folder "bluej/boot/src" 
        should have output folder "bluej/boot/classes"
      - source folder "bluej/test/src"
        should have output folder "bluej/test/classes"
      - source folder "bluej/threadchecker/src"
        should have output folder "bluej/threadchecker/classes"
      
   In the Libraries tab:
   
   * "Add JARs" (or "Add Variable..." if using classpath vars): add all the
     necessary jars from the bluej/lib directory.  At the time of this 
     writing (06/2016 v3.1.7) these are:

       - commons-logging-api-1.1.2.jar
       - diffutils-1.2.1.jar
       - guava-17.0.jar
       - hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
       - httpclient-4.1.1.jar
       - httpcore-4.1.jar
       - httpmime-4.1.1.jar
       - jsch-0.1.53
       - junit-4.12.jar
       - nsmenufx-2.1.8.jar
       - org.eclipse.jgit-4.9.0.jar
       - xom-1.2.9.jar


4. Configuring and running ant

   * Copy the bluej/build.properties.template file to
     bluej/build.properties and set local paths.

     Eclipse likes to open the file build.properties with a "Build
     Configuration" editor - you don't want that.  Right-click and
     choose "open with", "Properties file editor".

   * Right click in project view on build.xml-> Run as "ant build..."
     (ellipis important).

   * Click in jre tab and make sure that the jdk (not just a jre) is
     selected.


   Window->Show View->Other... 

   * select Ant->Ant in pop-up dialog

   * drag-n-drop the bluej/build.xml file from the bluej project into
     the Ant view.

   * double click on the "update-version-number" task to generate splash screens 
     (needed once unless version changes).

   * double click on the "ready-to-run" target to build.


5. Running BlueJ from within Eclipse

   Most edits will not require re-running the ant build targets nor
   installing bluej to test.

   You can edit the source and run BlueJ from within Eclipse. To do
   this you need to have Eclipse set to "build automatically"
   (Project->"build automatically") and you need a run configuration:


   Run->Run Configurations...
   
   * Select "Java Application" and click the "New" button to create a
     new run configuration for bluej
   
   * Name it whatever you like, e.g. 'bluej_runconfig'.

   In the Main tab:

   * Project should be the bluej project
   * Main class should be bluej.Boot.

   In the Arguments tab:

   * Set the Program arguments to (not indented for easier copy&paste):

-useclassesdir=true 
-bluej.debug=true
-javafxpath=/path/to/javafx


   In the JRE tab:

   * check that the jre being used for the project is the jdk jre as
     described above.


   In the Classpath tab:

   * The bootstrap entries should contain only the JRE Sytem Library

   * The user entries should contain the "bluej/boot/classes" folder
     (Advanced..., Add Folder). You do not need the "classes" folder nor any
     of the other jar files.

   * Apply the changes and run the configuration to test.


6. Hacking BlueJ

   * Hack the source and run the run configuration using the "run"
     button in the toolbar to test.

   * Happy Hacking ;-)



======================================================================
Appendix

NOTE 1. on Eclipse Workspace folders:

How you import source code into Eclipse and how you may or may not
name the corresponding projects depends upon where the source is
located.

The default eclipse configuration is to have the source folders as
subdirectories in the eclipse workspace folder with the subdirs named
exactly the same as the projects themselves, e.g. "bluej"
and "greenfoot", but you can also have them in another directory and
then name the projects however you like, e.g. "bj" and "gf" or
even "fred" and "george". ;-) Buildpath folders, etc., are then
relative to these project names instead of the actual subdirectory
names.

You can have multiple workspace folders, e.g. a separate AndroidWS for
your android projects, and a BluejWS folder with the bluej source
folder in it for hacking BlueJ. Eclipse can prompt you on startup to
select a workspace folder to use for the session (set in Eclipse in
Window->Preferences->Startup and Shutdown->Workspaces. See Eclipse help
for further information.)

* Decide whether you want to have the bluej source folder in the
  eclipse workspace folder or not (similarly for the greenfoot source
  folder, if you are building Greenfoot; note that your BlueJ and
  Greenfoot folders should be in the same workspace as each other).

Tip: Extract the source into a folder called e.g. "BluejWS" and
     use this folder as your workspace folder when working on
     BlueJ.

* Start Eclipse. Select the appropriate workspace folder either at
  start up (see above) or in File->Switch Workspace.
