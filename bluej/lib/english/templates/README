This directory contains some templates used by BlueJ to generate files.
These templates may be edited to change the default content of generated
files.

 - The readme and readmeexp templates may be freely edited.
 - The html template should be edited with care - things may not work 
   if it is broken.
 - The shell template should probably NOT be edited (unless you REALLY
   know what you're doing).

The subdirectory "newclass" contains templates for classes generated
via the "New Class" function in BlueJ.
