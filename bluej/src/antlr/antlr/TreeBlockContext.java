 * ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or
 * incorporate any source code into one of your programs
 * (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
 * you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
 * research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
 * developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that

/**The context needed to add root,child elements to a Tree.  There
 * is only one alternative (i.e., a list of children).  We subclass to
 * specialize. MakeGrammar.addElementToCurrentAlt will work correctly
 * now for either a block of alts or a Tree child list.
 *
 * The first time addAlternativeElement is called, it sets the root element
 * rather than adding it to one of the alternative lists.  Rather than have
 * the grammar duplicate the rules for grammar atoms etc... we use the same
 * grammar and same refToken behavior etc...  We have to special case somewhere
 * and here is where we do it.
