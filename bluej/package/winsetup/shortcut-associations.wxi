       <!-- For the shortcuts in this file, we also add a registry key.  The key doesn't
            do anything, other than effectively recording that the shortcuts were created.
            This key makes a unique path that is associated with the registry key, which
            avoids us having to create extra GUIDs for each shortcut to uniquely identify them.
            The KeyPath="yes" option indicates that the registry key is the unique path
            associated with that shortcut. -->
            
       <!-- There is one small irritation/bug that can't easily be worked around with the
            shortcuts.  WiX prevents the use of HKMU or HKLM for the root key when installing
            the shortcuts, so you must use HKCU, even though the keys may be installed
            for all users.  In practice, the shortcuts still install, but if uninstall
            for all users is performed by a different user than the one that installed for
            all users, it can leave two registry keys behind.  The shortcuts still get deleted,
            I believe.  There is no easy way round this with WiX 3.5; you can use a trick
            involving advertised shortcuts but that prevents optional installation of the shortcuts,
            and you can't use anything else as a key path because you get ICE38/ICE43 errors. -->
            
       <!-- This file generates a lot of ICE69 warnings, because the shortcuts are in a
            different installer component to the file (the launcher) that they point to.
            This means that in theory the shortcuts could exist without the file they are pointing to.
            However, in practice (and the reason this is only a warning), the components are
            in the same installer feature, so they should always be installed and uninstalled together. -->
            
        <!--  To make the shortcuts optional, I'm following:
